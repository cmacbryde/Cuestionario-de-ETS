        <p><strong>DYK?</strong> Nearly 1 in 5 people in the U.S. have a sexually transmitted infection (STI). However, STIs are not inevitable, and they can be prevented and treated. Make a plan and choose the prevention steps that work for you with Prepare Before You’re There. Take this brief, interactive quiz to get started.</p>
        
        <p>This quiz will help you know if you may be at risk for an STI. If you answer “yes” to any of the questions, you may want to talk with a healthcare provider to learn more about your risk and find out if you need to be tested for STIs.</p>
        
        <p>This quiz will not diagnose you with an infection. It also cannot predict if you will get one. It can help to determine if you are at risk for an STI.</p>
